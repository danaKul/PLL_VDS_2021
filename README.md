# PLL_VDS_2021  
## Why PLL?
PLL is used to get very precise clock signal without a frequency or phase noise. <br>
While Quartz crystals can do that, they have soem practical limitations like integrating on chip, because of which Voltage Controlled Oscillators(VCO) are instead used which are a part of PLL system. <br>

As seen in the block diagram, PLL  has a Phase Frequency Detector(PFD), Charge Pump(CP), Low Pass FIlter(LPF), VCO, and Frequency Divider(FD)
